 * How preferences get set, in three tiers — this file is tier 1:
 *
 *   1. Constants here and in core.css, enforced by the components below and
 *      by `npm run audit`.
 *   2. Components in `./patterns.ts` — a principle embodied in something you
 *      import cannot be violated by accident, which is stronger than any doc.
 *   3. Judgment, in `docs/manual-tests.md` — copy tone, whether an action
 *      deserves a confirmation. No machine decides those.
 *
 * Changing a number here changes it everywhere, and the tests pin the
 * behaviour that depends on it. Change one deliberately; do not work around it
 * in a component.
